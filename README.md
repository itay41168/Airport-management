# FlightManager – Flight Management System

## 📘 Overview
**FlightManager** is a desktop application developed as part of an academic project for a fictional airline company. The system manages data related to:

- Passengers
- Flight reservations
- Scheduled flights
- Actual flight tracking (real-time status)

The project started with building a Microsoft Access database and writing SQL queries. Later, a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to provide interaction 
with the database using JDBC.
